This is intended to be a repository with examples that illustrate various aspects of interfacing with an ntuple using uproot, awkward, numpy and native python datatypes (lists, dicts, etc.)
The idea is to read each of the trees (meta, output, waveforms) and visualize the data in different forms e.g. matplotlib walking through basic analysis and generating plots of
number of photons collected across events and the truth information as a histogram, waveform plots, metadata reading (macros and detector structure, etc.) an example ntuple file is included for testing
